##  How to Upload (Using Arduino IDE)

###  1. Install ESP8266 & SPIFFS Tools
- Install **ESP8266 Board** via Board Manager
- Add SPIFFS plugin (for Arduino 1.8.x only) â†’ [Plugin Guide](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin)

###  2. Upload the Web UI
1. Place `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` inside a `data/` folder in your sketch directory
2. In Arduino IDE, go to:  
   **Tools â†’ ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload**

### 3. Upload the Sketch
Upload `morseCodeTranslator_SPIFFS.ino` as usual
